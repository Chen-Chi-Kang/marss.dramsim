This is a set of tools we use for dealing with simulation results that come out of marss. 

I sincerely apologize for the code you're about to witness it was written in an evolutionary style 
so it's not particularly clean or elegant, but some of it might be useful for people to look at to 
design their own helper scripts.

I'll eventually try to write up some stuff about what there are intended to do ...

The graphing scripts rely heavily on numpy and matplotlib, which are excellent math and plotting 
libraries, respectively. 

More details to come.
